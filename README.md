  - Establishes bidirectional communication channels with the ExpenseManager, enabling real-time synchronization of user actions and expense data manipulation.

### ExpenseManager.swift

- **Role**: Centralized hub for managing expense-related data and operations.
- **Functionality**:
  - Implements a robust data model incorporating Swift's Codable protocol for seamless serialization and deserialization of expense objects.
  - Employs Swift's powerful ObservableObject protocol to enable reactive updates to expense data, ensuring UI consistency and responsiveness.
  - Integrates advanced algorithms for calculating essential financial metrics such as total expenses, remaining balance, and average daily expenditure, providing users with comprehensive insights into their financial health.

### SettingsView.swift

- **Role**: Configuration interface for application-wide settings and preferences.
- **Functionality**:
  - Leverages SwiftUI's modular design principles to encapsulate settings-related logic and presentation.
  - Implements reactive UI elements bound to underlying data models, ensuring real-time synchronization of user preferences with persistent storage.
  - Incorporates advanced user interaction patterns such as toggles and sliders, enhancing user engagement and customization options.

### LogsView.swift & MonthLogsView.swift

- **Role**: Presentation layer for visualizing expense logs and detailed monthly summaries.
- **Functionality**:
  - Harnesses SwiftUI's powerful data-driven rendering capabilities to dynamically display expense data in a structured and visually appealing format.
  - Implements complex data querying and filtering mechanisms to enable users to explore their financial data with precision and granularity.
  - Integrates with SwiftUI's native search functionality to facilitate seamless exploration and discovery of expense-related information.

### ExpenseRow.swift & BadgeView.swift

- **Role**: Visual components for enhancing the presentation of individual expense items and categories.
- **Functionality**:
  - Implements custom UI elements optimized for rendering expense data with elegance and clarity.
  - Incorporates advanced animation techniques to create visually engaging interactions, enhancing the overall user experience.
  - Utilizes SwiftUI's composability features to encapsulate reusable UI components, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

## Key Functionalities
